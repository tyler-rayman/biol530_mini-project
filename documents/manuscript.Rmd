# Abstract

# Introduction

Body size is an important biological trait that influences ecology, energetics, and survival.  
In penguins, body mass may vary across geographic locations due to environmental differences or species composition.  

This study explores whether penguin body mass differs across islands using the Palmer Penguins dataset (Horst et al., 2020).

# Methods

## Data Source

Data were obtained from the `palmerpenguins` R package (Horst et al., 2020).  
The raw dataset was exported to CSV using `scripts/01_load_raw_penguins.R`.  

Data cleaning was performed using `scripts/02_clean_penguins.R`, which:
- Selected the variables `island` and `body_mass_g`
- Removed rows containing missing values
- Generated a processed dataset for analysis

## Statistical Analysis

All analyses were performed in R.

# Results

(Resultsinserted here after analysis.)

# Discussion

Differences in body mass across islands may reflect... insert reasons. 

Because this dataset is observational, results should not be interpreted as causal.

# Reproducibility

All data processing and analysis scripts are available in the `scripts` directory.
